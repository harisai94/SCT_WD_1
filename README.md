TASK 01- Responsive landing Page[My Tournamnet Website for Free Fire]
Introduction:

I have made my tournament Website that has responsive features when we hover on the buttons.
This page is particularly for the gamers who want to earn money by playing the game.

ðŸ”¥ Tournament Fire â€“ Website Overview & Features
The Tournament Fire website is a dynamic, one-page layout designed for gamers and tournament enthusiasts. It offers a sleek, engaging user experience through responsive design, vivid visuals, and interactive elements that make browsing enjoyable on all devices.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features & Design Highlights
ðŸ§­ 1. Smooth Navigation
A sticky, top-aligned navigation bar ensures users can easily move between sections: Home, About, Tournaments, Refer & Earn, and Contact Us.
Each menu link highlights on hover with a smooth color transition to bright cyan  â€” providing clear feedback and style.

ðŸ“· 2. Hero Section with Logo Image
The homepage greets users with a centered, circular promotional image (tour2.webp) enhanced by a soft glow and rounded border.
The image scales well on mobile thanks to responsive max-width: 90% and box-shadow effects.

ðŸ§¾ 3. About & Features Section
The About Us section explains the platformâ€™s mission with large, readable text in a calming aqua font.
A Features grid showcases benefits like Fair Play, Fast Performance, Money Security, and Real Earning, each in a glowing box with a red accent border.
Hovering over each feature card reveals subtle elevation effects that bring the section to life.

ðŸŽ® 4. Tournaments Showcase
The Tournaments section is the visual centerpiece, arranged in a responsive grid layout.
Each tournament card features:

A glowing border

Bold tournament titles

Descriptive subheadings

A hover/keyboard focus effect that adds depth and movement through transform and glowing box-shadow.

ðŸŽ¨ 5. Visual & Background Design
The website uses a high-quality background image (background.avif) set to cover the full screen, giving an immersive feel.

A dark, semi-transparent overlay keeps text readable while allowing the background to show through.

Color palette:

Red accents  for energy and urgency

Cyan glows  for a modern, tech-forward feel

Dark overlay for contrast and focus

ðŸ“± 6. Fully Responsive Design
The site adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes using flexible CSS grid layouts and scalable units.

Buttons, images, and cards resize appropriately without loss of functionality or style.

âœ¨ Interactive Experience with Hover Effects
Navigation links glow and underline smoothly when hovered.

Tournament cards lift off the page and glow when focused or hovered.

Buttons and clickable areas respond visually, enhancing user engagement without the need for JavaScript.
